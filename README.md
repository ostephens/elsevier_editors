This is a scraper that ran on [Morph](https://morph.io).

This code attempts to find and extract the editorial board members for Elsevier journals. It uses a list of Elsevier journals published by the Jisc KB+ under a CC0 licence as the starting point.

Having written this code, it occurred to me that extracting this information is possibly in contravention of the Data Protection Act 1988 as it deals with personally identifiable information. Because of this I have removed the scraper from Morph.io.
