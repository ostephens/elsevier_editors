This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

This scraper attempts to find and extract the editorial board members for Elsevier journals. It uses a list of Elsevier journals published by the Jisc KB+ under a CC0 licence as the starting point.

This has not been extensively checked and tested, so it is likely that some of the information has not been scraped accurately. Checking the relevant pages published by Elsevier (linked in the data) for accurate information is always advised.
